# Nydus
A Java test bed for testing pathfinding algorithms.

The project features a graphical display for various pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms
Arbitrary pathfinding algorithms can be plugged into the interface for this project. The purpose is to practice and demonstrate the usage of the algorithms. 
- [ ] Dijkstra 
- [x] A*
  - [x] Depth-limited A* (see [Lightning AI](https://github.com/Shadowen/Lightning-AI))
  - [ ] Heirarchical A*
- [ ] Boid (see [Zergling Speed](https://github.com/Shadowen/ZerglingSpeed))

## Graphs
Some algorithms only work with certain graph formations. `Nydus` can generate the following graph shapes.
- [x] 2D Maze (Grid)
- [x] Free 2D space (integral coordinates) (see [Lightning AI](https://github.com/Shadowen/Lightning-AI))
- [x] Arbitrary graph (see [StaircaseChallenge](https://github.com/Shadowen/StaircaseChallenge))
